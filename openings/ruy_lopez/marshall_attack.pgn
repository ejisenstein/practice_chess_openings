{ I am obliged to show you this wonderful game. Capablanca with white pieces faces Marshall with black pieces. This was the first time the Marshall attack was played. Capablanca, brake which for many is "The Greatest Attack in History."

This game will help you defend the Marshall Attack in a more successful way in your games with Ruy Lopez.

Enjoy this game of attacks and defenses :D }
